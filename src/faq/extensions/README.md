## MangaDex

### No results when searching

::: tip
Make sure you're on app version `0.8.4` or higher.
:::

If you're not getting any results when searching MangaDex then
you need to log in.

To do so, go to `Browse`/`Latest` for MangaDex under `Catalogues`, open
any manga from the list and then press the overflow menu (3 dot menu)
in the top-right corner and then the `Open in web view` button.

Now go to the hamburger menu, press the `Manga` drop-down and then
choose either `Sign up` or `Log in` to proceed with the log in.

### Chapters from Mangaplus are broken

Install the Mangaplus extension and then migrate the manga that
uses Mangaplus on Mangadex onto the Mangaplus source.

## MangaRock

### Slow updates to Tachiyomi

MangaRock's API updates less frequently than the app or the website,
so you may need to wait a couple hours or more before it shows up
in Tachiyomi.

## Madara

### Leviatan Scans is missing

Leviatan Scans has shifted from Madara to Genkan extension.

Install Genkan. Migrate all Leviatan scans. Update Madara.
