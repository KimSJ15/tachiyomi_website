# Reading with Local Source

## How do I import my downloaded series into Tachiyomi?*

We recommend you to read [this](../../../guides/local-series/index.md) guide on how to do so.

## What do I do if I cannot find the Tachiyomi folder?

If you do not see the **Tachiyomi** folder, create one with a file manager.

## How do I fix empty/blank covers on my local series?

Sometimes some covers for local series are not displayed.
Follow these steps to fix it:

1. Make sure you have created the right folder structure.
   1. To check that you have, open the series with the missing cover and check if you can read chapters in the app.
   1. If not, follow this guide first.
1. Take a screenshot of which chapters you have read, and then remove series from the library.
1. Go to → → and tap **Clear database**.
   1. This will only affect series that are not in your library.
1. Go back to the → **Local source** and find the series.
   1. The cover should be fixed now.
   1. Add the series back to your library, mark your read chapters, and re-add tracking if needed.
